# Task Management System

*Goal*: Develop a simple task management system that allows users to create, view, update, and
delete tasks. The application should have a user-friendly interface and provide basic
functionality for managing tasks.

Required:
i. Using python as your backend language and other tools (framework, language and
database) of your choice, design and implement a mobile or web application to solve
the problem.
ii. The program should have two parts: User Interface (UI) - to capture input and display
output, and a BACKEND API â€“ to perform all the necessary computations based on the
input and feeding the UI with the output.
Features to consider:
1. User Registration
2. User Login
3. Task Creation: Users should be able to create new tasks by providing a title, description,
and due date.
4. Task Listing: Display a list of tasks for the logged-in user, including the task title, due date,
and status (e.g., pending, completed).
5. Task Update
6. Task Deletion
7. Task Status Update: Allow users to mark tasks as completed or change their status.
8. User Logout
